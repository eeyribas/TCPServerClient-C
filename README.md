# TCPServerClient-C
An application that uses TCP communication and can operate as either a server or a client.
When run with the argument "0", the application functions as a server.
If it is run with any argument other than "0", it functions as a client.
Once the server establishes a TCP connection with the client, it sends the message "Hello Client!".
