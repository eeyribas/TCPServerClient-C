# TCPServerClient-C
The application, which communicates via TCP, can operate in server and client modes. It is coded in the C programming language and uses the Qt IDE. 
When the application is run with an argument of zero, it operates as a server. When an argument other than zero is provided, it operates as a client. 
After the server connects with the client via TCP communication, it sends the message 'Hello Client!'
